                    Starting to work on the map view of the GNU Social Fediverse. <strong>WARNING: </strong> Map view still does *not* work.                    
                </p>

                    There is a new field in the sqlite db to indicate if a node is NSFW. If this value is 1, then the frontend table
                    will show a NSFW red label.
                    <br />

                    A typo reported by <a href="https://shitposter.club/rw" target="_blank">@rw</a> was corrected in the frontpage.

                    Starting today nodes added via the top left green button, now go directly into the database and are automatically queried for their data. So, nodes need to be up and running when being added,
                    else they will be automatically rejected since the fediverse.org won't be able to access their config and general status.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also as it was suggested by <a href="https://gnusocial.de/vinzv" target="_blank">@vinzv</a>, in the table view (the only possible view at the moment, since maps are not ready yet),
                    nodes that have no "text-limit" configured for the length of their queets, will show the more accurate "no limit" label,
                    in replacement of the former "false" one, since its better from a general user pespective.
                </p>
