                    This is a list of pending tasks and suggestions of what to implement in future versions.
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>[ ! ]</strong> Build a <strong>score system</strong> to order nodes by various criteria. We should take into consideration uptime, if they're open for public signups, if they encourages free speech, and users' votes.</li>
                        <li>Fix map markers behavior issue when zooming in/out.</li>
                        <li>For better transparency, make available at the homepage the last log file from the fediverse parser.</li>
                        <li>Add the positibility to have nodes pages with the details of the node, a up/down vote functionality and a comment syste. Disqus?</li>
                        <li>Add a button for those newcomers who just want to be taken to the "best", or highest scoring, node.</li>
                        <li>Create a fallback method to fetch geolocation data for IP addresses from an API when that information is not available in the local MaxMind database.</li>
                        <li>Add a fallback method for the cross browser xhr query that checks if nodes are up.</li>
                        <li>Add a way to categorize nodes for filtering purposes. Categories should include: adult, shitposting, private, conservative, liberal, etc. This might be considered controversial or unfair for certain nodes, so we should consider it carefully.</li>                        
                        <li>Query each node for the Statistics plugin when it exists. Give a score bonus to nodes that are transparent with their statistics.</li>
                        <li>Add the possibility to ping every 5-10 minutos in the frontend, for users who want to keep the fediverse.org site open and have an status.</li>
                    </ul>                    
                </p>

                    Soon I will add a simpler way for people to share their opinions and suggestions. For now, feel free to open an issue on <a href="<?php echo FEDIVERSE_GITHUB; ?>/issues">GitHub</a>.
