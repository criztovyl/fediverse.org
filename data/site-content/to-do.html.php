                    Pendings and Suggestions

                    This is a list of pendings and suggestions to implement in future versions.
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>[ ! ]</strong> Make a much better "Add node" functionality, now its manual. Currently, nodes suggested by users are stored in a plain text file and later processed manually.</li>
                        <li><strong>[ ! ]</strong> Since pinging via client javascript turned out to be more reliable than server pinging (which fediverse still does every 15 minutes via a cronjob), lets try some LocalStorage so if visitors browse the page, and return to homepage we do not ping again automaticallly, but get results from LocalStorage. If last js ping was 15 mins or ago ormore, then yes, re-ping automatically. That way we do not disturb nodes so much.</li>
                        <li><strong>[ ! ]</strong> Build a <strong>score system</strong> to order nodes according to that number which should take into consideration uptime, if its open for signups, if it encourages free speech, and users votes for nodes in question.</li>
                        <li>Add the positibility to have nodes pages with the details of the node, a up/down vote functionality and a comment syste. Disqus?</li>
                        <li>Add a button for those newcommers who just want to be taken to "the best possible node", based on the Score system.</li>
                        <li>Create a fallback method to get the geo data for IP addresses from API, when that information is not available in the local MxMind geoip db.</li>
                        <li>Add a fallback method for the cross browser xhr query that checks if nodes are up.</li>
                        <li>Add a way to categorize nodes (so users can filter), in categories like: adult, shitposting, private, conservative, liberal, etc. This can be contriversial or unfair for certain nodes, so, think it over again later.</li>
                        <li><strong>[ ! ]</strong> Code the Map with the Lat/Long coordinates obtained from the MaxMind Sqlite Db.</li>
                        <li>Query for the Statistics plugin when exists, for each node. Give an extra "score value" to nodes that are transparent to the statistics.</li>
                    </ul>                    
                </p>
